# Offline Profile Helper

Companion app for Fika players who can't or don't want to run their server 24/7 but still let some play solo. Can be used over internet, VPN, or LAN.

## How To Use

- Place the EXE in your SPT/Fika game folder.
- Have your usual Fika server URL in launcher settings on first launch.
- Only use this app with both launcher and server closed.

Download Profile - download your profile, just like the button on the game's main menu. You can use this in case you forgot to download before closing your game

Overwrite Profile - copy your profile from `user/fika` to `user/profile` and overwrite it **without confirmation**

Upload Profile - upload your profile to the server so you don't need to send it to the server host manually and have them insert it before starting the server

Switch Server - switch your launcher config between your local server and friend's Fika server
